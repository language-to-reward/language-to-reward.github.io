Describe the motion of a dog robot using the following form:

[start of description]
This {CHOICE: [is, is not]} a new task.
The torso of the robot should roll by [NUM: 0.0] degrees towards right, the torso should pitch upward at [NUM: 0.0] degrees.
The height of the robot's CoM or torso center should be at [NUM: 0.3] meters.
The robot should {CHOICE: [face certain direction, turn at certain speed]}. If facing certain direction, it should be facing {CHOICE: [east, south, north, west]}. If turning, it should turn at [NUM: 0.0] degrees/s.
The robot should {CHOICE: [go to a certain location, move at certain speed]}. If going to certain location, it should go to (x=[NUM: 0.0], y=[NUM: 0.0]). If moving at certain speed, it should move forward at [NUM: 0.0]m/s and sideways at [NUM: 0.0]m/s (positive means left).
[optional] front_left foot lifted to [NUM: 0.0] meters high. 
[optional] back_left foot lifted to [NUM: 0.0] meters high.
[optional] front_right foot lifted to [NUM: 0.0] meters high.
[optional] back_right foot lifted to [NUM: 0.0] meters high.
[optional] front_left foot extend forward by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] back_left foot extend forward by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] front_right foot extend forward by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] back_right foot extend forward by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] front_left foot shifts inward laterally by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] back_left foot shifts inward laterally by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] front_right foot shifts inward laterally by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] back_right foot shifts inward laterally by [NUM: 0.0] meters.
[optional] front_left foot steps on the ground at a frequency of [NUM: 0.0] Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move [NUM: 0.0] meters up and down, and [NUM: 0.0] meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking {CHOICE: forward, back}, spending [NUM: 0.0] portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
[optional] back_left foot steps on the ground at a frequency of [NUM: 0.0] Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move [NUM: 0.0] meters up and down, and [NUM: 0.0] meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking {CHOICE: forward, back}, spending [NUM: 0.0] portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
[optional] front_right foot steps on the ground at a frequency of [NUM: 0.0] Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move [NUM: 0.0] meters up and down, and [NUM: 0.0] meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking {CHOICE: forward, back}, spending [NUM: 0.0] portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
[optional] back_right foot steps on the ground at a frequency of [NUM: 0.0] Hz, during the stepping motion, the foot will move [NUM: 0.0] meters up and down, and [NUM: 0.0] meters forward and back, drawing a circle as if it's walking {CHOICE: forward, back}, spending [NUM: 0.0] portion of the time in the air vs gait cycle.
[optional] The phase offsets for the four legs should be front_left: [NUM: 0.0], back_left: [NUM: 0.0], front_right: [NUM: 0.0], back_right: [NUM: 0.0].

Rules:
1. If you see phrases like [NUM: default_value], replace the entire phrase with a numerical value. If you see [PNUM: default_value], replace it with a positive, non-zero numerical value.
2. If you see phrases like {CHOICE: [choice1, choice2, ...]}, it means you should replace the entire phrase with one of the choices listed. Be sure to replace all of them. If you are not sure about the value, just use your best judgement.
3. Phase offset is between [0, 1]. So if two legs' phase offset differs by 0 or 1 they are moving in synchronous. If they have phase offset difference of 0.5, they are moving opposite in the gait cycle.
4. The portion of air vs the gait cycle is between [0, 1]. So if it's 0, it means the foot will always stay on the ground, and if it's 1 it means the foot will always be in the air.
5. I will tell you a behavior/skill/task that I want the quadruped to perform and you will provide the full description of the quadruped motion, even if you may only need to change a few lines. Always start the description with [start of description] and end it with [end of description].
6. We can assume that the robot has a good low-level controller that maintains balance and stability as long as it's in a reasonable pose.
7. You can assume that the robot is capable of doing anything, even for the most challenging task.
8. The robot is about 0.3m high in CoM or torso center when it's standing on all four feet with horizontal body. It's about 0.65m high when it stand upright on two feet with vertical body. When the robot's torso/body is flat and parallel to the ground, the pitch and roll angles are both 0.
9. Holding a foot 0.0m in the air is the same as saying it should maintain contact with the ground.
10. Do not add additional descriptions not shown above. Only use the bullet points given in the template.
11. If a bullet point is marked [optional], do NOT add it unless it's absolutely needed.
12. Use as few bullet points as possible. Be concise.

If you understand, say Yes.
