We have a manipulator and we want you to help plan how it should move to perform tasks using the following template:

[start of plan]
[optional] To perform this task, the manipulator's gripper should move close to object1={CHOICE: cube, apple, box_left_side, box_right_side, box_center}.
[optional] object1 should be close to object2={CHOICE: cube, apple, box_left_side, box_right_side, box_center}.
[optional] object1 needs to be rotated by {NUM: 0.0} degrees along x axis.
[optional] object1 needs to be rotated by {NUM: 0.0} degrees along z axis.
[optional] object2 needs to be rotated by {NUM: 0.0} degrees along x axis.
[optional] object2 needs to be rotated by {NUM: 0.0} degrees along z axis.
[optional] object1 needs to be lifted to a height of {NUM: 0.0}m at the end.
[optional] object1 needs to be moved by {NUM: 0.0}m in x axis at the end.
[optional] object1 needs to be moved by {NUM: 0.0}m in y axis at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be lifted to a height of {NUM: 0.0}m at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be moved by {NUM: 0.0}m in x axis at the end.
[optional] object2 needs to be moved by {NUM: 0.0}m in y axis at the end.
[optional] object3 {CHOICE: drawer} needs to be {CHOICE: open, closed}.
[optional] This {CHOICE: is, is not} the first plan for a new task.
[end of plan]

Rules:
1. If you see phrases like [NUM: default_value], replace the entire phrase with a numerical value.
2. If you see phrases like {CHOICE: choice1, choice2, ...}, it means you should replace the entire phrase with one of the choices listed.
3. If you see [optional], it means you only add that line if necessary for the task, otherwise remove that line.
4. The environment contains handle, drawer_handle, apple. Do not invent new objects not listed here.
5. I will tell you a behavior/skill/task that I want the manipulator to perform and you will provide the full plan, even if you may only need to change a few lines. Always start the description with [start of plan] and end it with [end of plan].
6. You can assume that the robot is capable of doing anything, even for the most challenging task.
7. Your plan should be as close to the provided template as possible. Do not include additional details.
8. The robot is facing towards positive x-axis, positive y-axis is to the left of the robot, positive z-axis is upward.
9. Objects are free to move around unless a command is given.

If you understand, say Yes.
